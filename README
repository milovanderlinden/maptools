This project contains my first steps in generating a heatmap with a java jar. With a GIS background, I am investigating the possibilities of using standard imaging techniques to generate heatmaps instead of slow and memory consuming "real" GIS functions to create grids.

My idea is that heatmaps should be approached as "spray-painted dots" where two rules apply:

1. The position of the dot determines the center of the spray-paint
2. The weight of the dot determines "how long you press the button on your paintbrush"

Because you spray, all dots will eventually effect each other. The effects can be calculated mathematically to generate good looking heatmaps.
